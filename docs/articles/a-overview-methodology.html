<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>On the contrary to popular approaches used to study inter-rater agreement, the present method considers the ratings data provided by all raters when studying the structure of disagreement among the panel. More precisely, the structure of disagreement is captured through the profiles of residuals of a no-latent class regression model adjusted on the entire set of ratings, and can be visualized by using exploratory data analysis tools.</p>
<p>The disagreement between two raters is then quantify in a concise way through the Euclidean distance between their respective profiles of residuals, this disagreement index being used as a basis to construct a dendrogram representing the structure of disagreement among the panel.</p>
<p>The proper number of disagreed clusters among the panel of raters is then chosen by implementing a sequential strategy to test the significance of each <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-clusters structure of disagreement. This modeling framework provides to the user a partition of the panel in several disagreed clusters of raters.</p>
<p>Finally, the approach allows the user to consolidate the previous partition of raters by using a partitioning algorithm, and to interpret the obtained clusters of raters by using covariates providing pieces of information about the raters themselves and/or about the stimuli rated during the experiment.</p>
</div>
<div id="modeling-framework" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#modeling-framework" class="anchor"></a>Modeling framework</h2>
<p>We propose hereafter a general modeling framework for the whole agreement data that introduces both stimuli and raters propensity scores by estimating the marginal distributions of ratings across all raters and all stimuli and not pairwise agreement tables, as this is done usually in inter-rater agreement studies. In the former regression framework, a latent modular structure of disagreement is also introduced as a particular <span class="math inline">\(stimulus \times rater\)</span> interaction structure.</p>
<p>In the following, it will be assumed that the panel <span class="math inline">\({\cal C} = [1;R]\)</span> of raters, where <span class="math inline">\(R \geq 2\)</span> is the number of raters, is partitioned into <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> clusters <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}, k=1, \ldots, K\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(1 \leq K \leq R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bigcup_{k} {\cal C}_{k}={\cal C}\)</span> and, for all <span class="math inline">\(k \neq k'\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k} \cap {\cal C}_{k'}=\emptyset\)</span>. The number of raters in cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span> will hereafter be denoted <span class="math inline">\(R_{k}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(R_{k} \geq 2\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(Y_{srk}\)</span> denote the rating of the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-th stimulus, with <span class="math inline">\(s=1,\ldots,S\)</span>, by the <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-th rater in cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span>. The following latent class regression model is assumed:</p>
<center>
<span class="math inline">\(g(Y_{srk})=\mu+\alpha_{s}+\beta_{r|k}+\delta_{k}+(\alpha\delta)_{sk}\)</span> (1)
</center>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the link function, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{s}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{r|k}\)</span> are main effect parameters for the stimuli and the raters respectively, the notation <span class="math inline">\(r|k\)</span> being used here to indicate that the <span class="math inline">\(rater\)</span> effect is embedded into the <span class="math inline">\(latent \ class\)</span> effect. Those parameters <span class="math inline">\((\alpha_{s})_{s=1,\ldots,S}\)</span> can be referred to as stimulus propensity scores, whereas, for all <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((\beta_{r|k})_{r=1,\ldots,R_{k}}\)</span> can be viewed as cluster-specific rater propensity scores. Analogously, <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{k}\)</span> is the propensity score for cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((\alpha\delta)_{sk}\)</span> stands for the <span class="math inline">\(stimulus \times cluster\)</span> interaction effect.</p>
<p>Note that the following additive model is obtained as a special case of the model (1) when no latent class structure (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(K=1\)</span>) is assumed:</p>
<center>
<span class="math inline">\(g(Y_{srk})=\mu+\alpha_{s}+\beta_{r}\)</span>
</center>
<p>Discussing the relevance of propensity scores in models (1) and (2) is out of the purpose of the present vignette. Anyway, the package allows the user to decide to consider or not the stimuli-specific parameters and/or the raters-specific parameters when modeling the ratings provided by the panel.</p>

<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#constructing-the-dendrogram-representing-the-structure-of-disagreement-among-the-panel" class="anchor"></a>Constructing the dendrogram representing the structure of disagreement among the panel</h3>
<p>Since a perfect fit of model (2) would mean that the rating of a given stimulus does not vary from one rater to another, it will be considered as a <em>perfect agreement</em> model. Accordingly, model (1) can be viewed as a finite mixture of within-cluster <em>perfect agreement</em> models in the sense that model (2) holds within each cluster with cluster-specific propensity scores. Therefore, model (2) departs from the <em>perfect agreement</em> model by capturing a possible between-clusters disagreement on the ratings of the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-th stimulus through the <span class="math inline">\(cluster \times stimulus\)</span> interaction parameters.</p>
<p>As ratings data have no replication, the two-way interaction <span class="math inline">\(cluster \times stimulus\)</span> is a part of the error term of model (2). This is why this error term can be used to model the heterogeneity in the ratings provided by the raters; the possible pattern of heterogeneity between the ratings being defined as the gap between the observed values and the values adjusted with model (2). Consequently, the possible pattern of disagreement between the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> raters among the panel can be seen as a discrepancy between the observed values and the values adjusted with the logistic regression model of perfect agreement (2), this discrepancy being measurable by the residuals of model (2):</p>
<center>
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\varepsilon}_{sr}\)</span>
</center>
<p>Two raters having the same <span class="math inline">\(S-\)</span>profile of residuals <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\varepsilon}_{r}=(\hat{\varepsilon}_{r1},\ldots,\hat{\varepsilon}_{rS})'\)</span> would depart from the full agreement model the same way, and, consistently should appear in the same disagreement cluster. Therefore, we propose to consider the Euclidean distance <span class="math inline">\(d^{\scriptscriptstyle \text{res}}_{rr'}\)</span> between the profiles of residuals as a dissimilarity index between raters <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r'\)</span>:</p>
<center>
<span class="math inline">\(d^{\scriptscriptstyle \text{res}}_{rr'} = \sqrt{\sum\limits_{s=1}^{S}(\hat{\varepsilon}_{sr} - \hat{\varepsilon}_{sr'} )^{2}}\)</span>
</center>
<p>Moreover, since the deviance residuals <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\varepsilon}_{rs}\)</span> are approximately distributed according to a standard normal distribution, any model-based or not clustering algorithm applied on the dissimilarity matrix <span class="math inline">\(D^{\scriptscriptstyle \text{res}}\)</span> with generic term <span class="math inline">\(d^{\scriptscriptstyle \text{res}}_{rr'}\)</span> can be used to extract modules of raters sharing the same pattern of rating for the stimuli.</p>
<p>Agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms is favored to extract the latent class disagreement structure from the dissimilarity matrix <span class="math inline">\(D^{\scriptscriptstyle \text{res}}\)</span>. Indeed, these algorithms provide a sequence of nested partitions of the raters deduced from a dendrogram, starting from a full consensus among all raters (one cluster) to the extreme situation of a complete disagreement with as many clusters as raters. In the following, the former Ward’s algorithm is used to infer on the latent class disagreement pattern.</p>
<p>In the next section, a fitting procedure is proposed with ad-hoc testing methods for the significance of the latent class disagreement model.</p>

<a href="#cutting-the-dendrogram-at-the-proper-level" class="anchor"></a>Cutting the dendrogram at the proper level</h3>
<p>Sequentially testing the significance of a <span class="math inline">\((K+1)-\)</span>clusters structure embedded in a <span class="math inline">\(K-\)</span>clusters super-structure can be addressed by analysis of model comparison tests in the general framework of model (1).</p>
<p>For a fixed number, say <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, of clusters, fitting the <span class="math inline">\(K-\)</span> latent class model (1) involves three steps: first, maximum-likelihood fitting of <em>perfect agreement</em> model (1); then, extraction of the best <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-clusters partition using the Ward’s algorithm applied to the Euclidean distance matrix of residuals <span class="math inline">\(D^{\scriptscriptstyle \text{res}}\)</span>; and finally, maximum-likelihood fitting of model (1), based on the former <span class="math inline">\(K-\)</span> latent class <span class="math inline">\(stimulus \times rater\)</span> interaction pattern. Retracing the dendrogram resulting from the Ward’s algorithm downward, starting from its top node, where all raters are classified in a unique cluster, and moving down it leads to a sequence of nested models (1) with increasing number of latent classes. Therefore, determination of the proper number of latent classes can be handled by sequential model comparison tests for the significance of the <span class="math inline">\((K+1)-\)</span> latent class model w.r.t the <span class="math inline">\(K-\)</span> latent class model. Note that the null distribution of the test statistics has to be adapted to the fact that the latent class interaction structure is inferred from the data. We propose to approximate this null distribution by a Monte-Carlo method, based on simulations of the null <span class="math inline">\(K-\)</span> latent class model (1) as estimated at the previous step. When the null hypothesis cannot longer be rejected, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is used as the proper number of clusters of raters among the panel.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(p-\)</span>value of each test is provided at the corresponding level of the dendrogram. If the 2-latent class model is not significant w.r.t the no-latent class model, that means that there is no necessity to cut the dendrogram and to segment the panel of raters. This aspect can highlights two kinds of situations: (1) the ratings provided by the raters are too heterogeneous to highlight consistent sub-clusters of raters; or (2) the ratings provided by the raters are too homogeneous to highlight consistent sub-clusters of raters, meaning that the panel of raters is composed of one homogeneous cluster of raters who provided consensual ratings. Naturally, this aspect is of the main interest in the context of studying the agreement/disagreement among the panel of raters. With the aim of providing this information, we propose to implement a statistical test to evaluate the goodness of fit of the no-latent class model (2). If the null hypothesis is not rejected, that means that the panel of raters rated the set of stimuli in a consensual way. The <span class="math inline">\(p-\)</span>value of this test is provided at the top node of the dendrogram (only if a no-latent class structure is found).</p>

<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#consolidating-the-partition-of-raters" class="anchor"></a>Consolidating the partition of raters</h3>
<p>Once the partition of raters is defined, it can been consolidated by introducing it as the initial partition of a partitioning algorithm. More precisely, in this case, a <span class="math inline">\(K-\)</span>means algorithm is implemented. In practice, at each step of this algorithm, each rater in affected to the cluster with the nearest center of gravity, serving as a prototype of the cluster. The partition resulting from this algorithm is finally conserved. In practice, the initial partition is never entirely replaced, but rather improved or <em>consolidated</em>.</p>

<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#interpreting-the-clusters-of-raters" class="anchor"></a>Interpreting the clusters of raters</h3>
<p>Once the final partition of raters is defined, clusters are described by information about the raters such as the percentage of raters in each cluster or the parangon of each cluster (i.e. the rater the nearest of the center of gravity of the cluster, who can be defined as the rater the most representative of the cluster). Moreover, if external information about the raters and/or about the stimuli are present in the data set, these covariates can be used to supplement the interpretation of the clusters of raters.</p>

<h4 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#interpreting-clusters-by-using-external-information-about-the-raters" class="anchor"></a>Interpreting clusters by using external information about the raters</h4>
<p>In some situations, supplementary information on the raters who participated to the experiment is available. These pieces of information often represent identity characteristics about the raters such as their gender, their age, their occupation, their level of expertise and so forth; but they can also represent habit characteristics. With the aim of characterizing the clusters of raters by using these pieces of information, univariate analyses are used to study the relationships between the clusters and the supplementary variables available about the raters. These univariate analyses depend on the type of the supplementary variables (i.e. continuous or categorical variables). They are described precisely in Husson et al. (2011) and implemented in the <code>FactoMineR</code> package (Lê, Josse &amp; Husson, 2008).</p>

<h5 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#describing-clusters-by-the-values-of-a-continuous-variable-describing-the-raters" class="anchor"></a>Describing clusters by the values of a continuous variable describing the raters</h5>
<p>First, the global effect of the <em>Cluster</em> variable on the continuous variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> describing the rater is studied through the global test of an analysis of variance model. If the global effect of the <em>Cluster</em> variable on the continuous variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is significant, the effect of each category of the <em>Cluster</em> variable is then studied independently. More precisely, for each category of the <em>Cluster</em> variable (i.e. for each cluster of raters), a <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>-test (a test value) is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  v\text{-test} = \frac{\bar{x_k}-\bar{x}}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{J_k}\left(\frac{R-R_k}{R-1}\right)}}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x_k}\)</span> stands for the average of the given continuous variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> for the raters of cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> stands for the average of the given continuous variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> for all the raters of the panel, and <span class="math inline">\(R_k\)</span> stands for the number of raters in cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span>.</p>
<p>This value <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>-test is used to test the following null hypothesis: . We therefore consider the random variable <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X_k}\)</span>, average of the values of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> taken by the raters in cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span>. Its expected value and variance are:</p>
<center>
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}(\bar{X_k})=\bar{x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{V}(\bar{X_k})=\frac{s^2}{R_k} \times \frac{R-R_k}{R-1}\)</span>
</center>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>-test can therefore be considered a <em>standardized</em> deviation between the average of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th cluster and the general average. Among other things, we can attribute a probability to the <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>-test. If, among the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> raters, the continuous variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is normally distributed according to the null hypothesis, the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X_k}\)</span> distribution is as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
  \bar{X_k}=\mathcal{N} \left(\bar{x},\frac{s}{\sqrt{R_k}}\sqrt{\frac{R-R_k}{R-1}} \right)
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>If the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is accepted, that means that the average of the continuous variable for cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span> equals the general average among the panel; and that, in other words, the continuous variable does not characterize cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span>. On the contrary, if the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is rejected, that means that the continuous variable characterizes cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span>. The sign of the <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>-test is then used to determine if the values of the continuous variable taken by the raters of cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span> are high (positive <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>-test) or low (negative <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>-test) w.r.t. the observations made on the entire panel.</p>

<p>First, the global effect of the <em>Cluster</em> variable on the categorical variable <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> describing the rater is studied through a chi-square test of independence. If the <em>Cluster</em> variable and the categorical variable <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> are not significantly independent, the effect of each category of the <em>Cluster</em> variable is then studied independently. More precisely, for each category of the <em>Cluster</em> variable (i.e. for each cluster of raters) and for a given level (noticed <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>) of the categorical variable <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, the aim is to determine if cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span> is characterized by this given level <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> or not. To do so, the proportion <span class="math inline">\(R_{kq}/R_{k}\)</span> corresponding to the proportion of raters among cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span> who take the given level <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is compared to the proportion <span class="math inline">\(R_{q}/J\)</span> corresponding to the proportion of raters among the entire panel who take the given level <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. These two proportions are equal under the null hypothesis of independence <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}

<p><span class="math inline">\(R_{k}\)</span> raters are randomly selected among <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. We shall focus on the random variable <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> equaled to the number <span class="math inline">\(R_{kq}\)</span> of occurrences of raters who have the characteristic <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, while it must be remembered that their sample size within the population is <span class="math inline">\(R_{q}\)</span>.

<p>If the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is accepted, that means that the level <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> does not characterize cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span>. On the contrary, if the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> is rejected, that means that the level <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> characterizes cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span>.

With the aim to characterize the clusters of raters by using these pieces of information, univariate analyses are used to study the relationship between the clusters and the supplementary variables available about the stimuli. These univariate depend on the type of the supplementary variables (i.e. continuous or categorical variables).</p>

<p>The interaction effect between the <em>Cluster</em> variable and the given continuous variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on the rating is studied through the following regression model involving sum contrasts:</p>

<p>To highlight these aspects, the significance of the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{k}\)</span> is studied.

If this is the case, that means that the impact of the continuous variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on the rating characterizes cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span>. The sign of the coefficient is then used to determine if large values of the continuous variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> led to high ratings (positive coefficient) or low ratings (negative coefficient) in cluster <span class="math inline">\({\cal C}_{k}\)</span> w.r.t. the observations made on the entire panel.</p>
